dwmstatus
=========

This is a fork of [dwmstatus](http://dwm.suckless.org/dwmstatus/), with some
minor functionality added.

The `master` branch should contain a relatively easy starting point for
modifications, while the `config` branch contains the configuration changes
I prefer for my desktop machines. The `laptop` branch adds functions that work
on my [T500](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T500), and `config-laptop`
contains changes for my specific machine.

*Warning*: Any non-`master` branch is subject to wild rebasing.
